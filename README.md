## About Me

I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app. :computer:

<!--I built this app to help everyone get to know me. I am a student at Code Fellows, I am currently learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. In the next couple of days, I will be working on this app. Feel free to contribute your ideas! I would love to learn from you!-->

### Reflections and Comments
 
- It's easy to understand the code, but is hard to understand why the logic is that way, understand the logic behind code is super importnat!
