## About Me

I built this app to help everyone get to know me. I am a student at Code Fellows, I am currently learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. In the next couple of days, I will be working on this app. Feel free to contribute your ideas! I would love to learn from you! :computer:

### Reflections and Comments
 
1. Since I am still a beginner, it took me a while to understand what I am doing and why I need those files.
2. learned why we need `.gitignore`, `markdownlint.json` and `eslintrc.json`.
