  <div>
    <p id="bio">
      Hello! My name is Brenda Jow, my last name pronounce just like “Jo”. I am from Taiwan, and I moved to Washington
      when I was 13 years old. During my free time, I like to play video games, read, and watch Disney+. I graduated
      from
      the University of Washington with BA in Early Childhood and Family Studies, I’ve been working at the preschool
      since
      then. Recently I decided to change my career to become a software developer, so I am studying at Code Fellows. My
      goal is to gain more experience at Code Fellows and land a job as Front-end developer!

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p id="fact">
      In the preschool where I worked, my colleague always called me “teacher Panda”. Because when I was teaching
      rhyming,
      a child came up with “panda” when we try to think what rhymes with my name. Kids love the name so much and ever
      since they all called me “teacher Panda”!
