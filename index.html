  <h1> About Me </h1>   
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Brenda Jow, my last name pronounce just like “Jo”. I am from Taiwan, and I  moved to Washington when I was 13 years old. During my free time, I like to play video games, read, and watch Disney+. I graduated from the University of Washington with BA in Early Childhood and Family Studies, I’ve been working at the preschool since then. Recently I decided to change my career to become a software developer, so I am studying at Code Fellows. My goal is to gain more experience at Code Fellows and land a job as Front-end developer! 
  </p>
  <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
  <p>
    In the preschool where I worked, my colleague always called me “teacher Panda”. Because when I was teaching rhyming, a child came up with “panda” when we try to think what rhymes with my name. Kids love the name so much and ever since they all called me “teacher Panda”!
